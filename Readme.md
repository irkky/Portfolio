## Data Flow

### Contact Form Flow
1. User fills out contact form with validation
2. Form data is validated client-side using Zod schema
3. Validated data is sent to `/api/contact` endpoint
4. Server validates the data again and logs the submission
5. Success/error response is sent back to client
6. Toast notification displays result to user

### Page Navigation
1. User clicks navigation links or buttons
2. Wouter handles client-side routing
3. Components are rendered within the Layout wrapper
4. Navigation state is maintained across page changes

- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via DATABASE_URL environment variable

### Deployment Commands
- `npm run dev`: Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build`: Build both frontend and backend for production
- `npm run start`: Start production server
- `npm run db:push`: Push database schema changes

## Theme Implementation

The dark theme is implemented using CSS custom properties and Tailwind's dark mode support:

```css
:root {
  --background: hsl(210, 40%, 98%);
  --foreground: hsl(215, 25%, 27%);
  /* ... other light theme variables */
}

.dark {
  --background: hsl(222, 84%, 5%);
  --foreground: hsl(210, 40%, 98%);
  /* ... other dark theme variables */
}
```

## Animation Implementation

Animations are built using Framer Motion with a custom `AnimatedSection` component:

```tsx
<AnimatedSection delay={0.2} variant="fadeUp">
  <YourContent />
</AnimatedSection>
```

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to the local development URL

## Theme Toggle

The theme toggle is located in the navigation bar and allows users to:
- Switch between light and dark themes
- Use system preference (default)
- Persist their choice across sessions

## Customization

### Adding New Animation Variants

To add new animation variants, modify the `AnimatedSection` component:

```tsx
const variants = {
  // ... existing variants
  yourNewVariant: {
    initial: { opacity: 0, rotate: -10 },
    animate: { opacity: 1, rotate: 0 }
  }
}
```

### Customizing Dark Mode Colors

Modify the CSS custom properties in `client/src/index.css`:

```css
.dark {
  --your-custom-color: hsl(your, values, here);
}
```

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers

## Performance

- Animations are optimized for 60fps
- Uses `transform` and `opacity` for smooth animations
- Animations only trigger once per element
- Lazy loading for better performance
